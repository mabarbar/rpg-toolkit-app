## Herby, before sending to Code Review I verified that:

- [ ] PR targets `develop` branch for development purposes or `main` for release.
- [ ] PR to `develop` will be `Squash and Merge` while others just `Merge Pull Request`
- [ ] PR title follows [conventional commits format](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13), example: _Feat: Create Pull Request template_
- [ ] ~~Code is coherent with code rules~~ TBD
